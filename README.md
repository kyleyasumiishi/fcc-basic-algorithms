## About

I solved these algorithmic challenges as part of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum.

freeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, Medium publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone.

## Lessons Learned

My goal for each freeCodeCamp project and set of challenges is simply to learn about new web development concepts and practice my programming skills.

Here are a few <em>new concepts</em> I learned and practiced by implementing these algorithms:

- Unit testing with Mocha and Chai
- Documenting JavaScript code with JSDoc
- JavaScript filename naming best practices
- Understanding String immutability
- String concatenation
- Arrow functions
- Using the ternary operator
- Shorthand syntax for declaring object literals
- Creating strings using template literals
- Regular expressions
- Various Array.prototype methods, including <code>filter()</code>, <code>forEach()</code>, <code>indexOf()</code>, <code>join()</code>, <code>keys()</code>, <code>map()</code>, <code>slice()</code>, <code>sort()</code>, and <code>splice()</code>
- Various String.prototype methods, including <code>indexOf()</code>, <code>match()</code>, <code>replace()</code>, <code>search()</code>, <code>slice()</code>, <code>split()</code>, and <code>trim()</code>
- Combining arrays with the spread operator
